# Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher is a cipher that takes an input and a shift factor and returns the encoded text.

Initially this project was command line based;however , now that I am learing Sinatra(Ruby Framework) it is deployed [here](https://glacial-citadel-66223.herokuapp.com/)!

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track.
The project itself can be seen [v1](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks) [v2](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-project?ref=lnav)!
