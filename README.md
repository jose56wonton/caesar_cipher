# Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher is a cipher that takes an input and a shift factor and returns the encoded text.

Initially this project was command line based; however, now it is an undeployed Sinatra(Ruby Framework) app!

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track.
