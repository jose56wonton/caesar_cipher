Caesar Cipher

* Caesar Cipher is a cipher that takes an input and a shift factor and returns the encoded text.

Initially this project was command line based; however, now that I am learing Sinatra(Ruby Framework) it is deployed [here]()

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks)!
